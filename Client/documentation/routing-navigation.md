# Routing and Navigation

## Packages

We use AutoRoute([auto_route pub](https://pub.dev/packages/auto_route)) for deep-linking, guarded routes and clean routing setup.


## Routing

All the routes are generated automatically, in the routes.dart file, by build_runner using the following command:

```shell
flutter packages pub run build_runner build
```
